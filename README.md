# NandToTetris - Part 1 (Coursera)
Building a mordern computer from first principles

Within this course, I am currently building a general-purpose computer system - from logic gates to an assembler - entirely from scratch, using hardware description language.

---

# What I have learned so far:

- How logic gates like AND, OR, and NOT are built from NAND
- The construction of more complex gates, multi-bit variants and multi-way variants

# Projects Overview
| Project | Description | Tools Used | Status |
|--------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| 01 | **Boolean Logic** â€“ Built basic gates from NAND (And, Or, Xor, Mux, etc.) | `HardwareSimulator` | âœ… Completed |
| 02 | **Boolean Arithmetic** â€“ Adders, ALU | `HardwareSimulator` | ðŸš§ In Progress |
| 03 | **Sequential Logic** â€“ Flip-flops, registers, RAM, Program Counter | `HardwareSimulator` | ðŸš§ In Progress |
| 04 | **Machine Language** â€“ Learned the Hack ISA and wrote assembly programs | `CPUEmulator` | ðŸš§ In Progress |
| 05 | **Computer Architecture** â€“ Built the Hack CPU and the full computer | `HardwareSimulator` | ðŸš§ In Progress |
| 06 | **Assembler** â€“ Wrote a translator for Hack assembly (in Python/Java) | Custom script + `CPUEmulator` | ðŸš§ In Progress |
